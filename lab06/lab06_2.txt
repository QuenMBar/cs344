We want the machine learned model to:
I want to predict what news people will find most useful.

Our ideal outcome is:
My ideal outcome is to allow people to find the news they want with less time searching for it.

Our success metrics are:
How long it takes to find news sources people are searching for, and the accuracy of the search.

Our key results (KR) for the success metrics are:
The time it takes.

Our ML model is deemed a failure if:
It takes longer to find the news than before.

The output from our ML model will be:
The time it takes for a user to find the information they want, and how satisfied they are with it.

The output is defined as:
Time and ratings

The output from the ML model will be made:
A timer and a survey

The outcome will be used for:
Recommending better news articles in the future

If we didn't use ML, we would:
Sort the news by hand

Our problem is best framed as:
Multi-class multi-label classification
