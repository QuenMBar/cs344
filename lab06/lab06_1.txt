The entropy before the split is 1 since there are an equal amount of yes and nos.  The information gain comes out to
0.1957.  This is done by computing the splits entropies and then scaling them by their weights and adding them together.
While this question does provide some information gain, because the data about being hungry doesnt lead to
a clear answer, it doesnt help alot.
