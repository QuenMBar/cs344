    "### Part one: Introspection:\n",
    "Introspection is the practice of looking inward, towards one’s own thoughts in an attempt to gain insight on how we work.  It is a practice that is as old as Plato and is very useful in the field of psychology.  Because of this, it is useful in modeling for AI, however only to an extent.  It is useful because a lot of the times we can teach the computers to solve the problems the same ways that we do.  This does have some limitations and drawbacks, though, since computers are mechanical in nature.  Sometimes the way that we do things in our heads is very inefficient because we do have limitations.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "I think that an interesting area to look at is vision.  As we are teaching computers to actually see, we are doing it in a way that is similar to how we learned to see.  For computers we have people label a bunch of objects and then feed it to programs to let them learn what those objects look like, which is a lot like how humans learn to recognize things.  However, even in this case, they don’t do it exactly the same, and the program can also be fooled a lot easier.  "

    " This program is creating a random map and then uses hill climbing and simulated annealing to try and solve the problem.  The states for the problem are lists of the order that the cities will be traveled to.  It was unclear whether the salesman was supposed to travel back to where he started in the end or not, so I made it an option for the program.  The actions that I chose were for the state given, find the longest path to the next city, and then make the actions variations of the state with the that city swapped for each other city.  This seemed to give me pretty good results, even with the hill climbing algorithm.  I also tried to just shuffle the state and give that back as an action, and while it didn’t work too well for hill climbing, it did work surprisingly well for simulated annealing.  This is most likely because it had a lot of random states to choose the answer from.  In terms of which algorithm worked the best, simulated annealing was more consistent, and on average it produced better results.  I implemented random restarts just to check this, and simulated annealing did show to be consistently faster.  This is most likely because this problem has a lot of good solutions, so it’s easy for both algorithms to find decent solutions.  However, hill climbing still can get stuck, so simulated annealing turned out to be better."
