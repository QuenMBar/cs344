b)
    i) GPS in gps.py is implemented as a function.
    ii) The initial states, goal states and operators are all lists.
    iii) The function is not recursive, only repetitive.  This is because, while
    there is a for loop, the functions are never called within themselves.
d)
    i) The code is based on the monkey and banana problem.  The rules of this puzzle is
    that there is a monkey in a room with only a chair and a stick, and with a banana on
    the ceiling that can only be reached by standing on the chair and hitting the banana
    with the stick.  The monkey also only knows how to move around, carry things around,
    reach for the banana, and wave the stick around.  I think that this code does not recreate
    the problem well because it doesn't include the stick and severely limits the actions the monkey has.
    ii) The GPS algorithm works by trying to complete its first goal by doing actions.  Then it
    looks at its second goal and tries to accomplish that.  It does this until all the goals are met,
    or that it decides that the problem can't be solved.
    iii) This code is a version of artificial intelligence.  I think this would be logic
    programing because it uses a set of rules to reach a conclusion. It could also be cognitive
    modeling because it uses a model to reach its answer.
    iv) I think that a monkey doing this in the real world would be displaying some sort of intelligence.
