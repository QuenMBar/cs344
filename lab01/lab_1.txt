b)
    i) GPS in gps.py is implemented as a function.
    ii) The initial states, goal states and operators are all lists.
    iii) The function is not recursive, only repetitive.  This is because while
    there is a for loop, the functions are never called within themselves.
d)
    i) The code is based on the monkey and banana problem.  The rules of this puzzle is
    that there is a monkey in a room with only a chair and a stick, and with a banana on
    the ceiling that can only be reached by standing on the chair and hitting the banana
    with the stick.  The monkey also only knows how to move around, carry things around,
    reach for the banana, and wave the stick around.  I think that this code does not recreate
    the problem well because it doesn't include the stick and severely limits the actions the monkey has.
    ii) The GPS algorithm first looks for what operators will achieve the goal, in this case it would be
    eat banana.  Then it looks for the operator that that will fulfill its preconditions.  In this case that
    would be grasp bananas.  Then it looks for what fulfills its preconditions, and it does this
    until it arrives at its initial state.
    iii) This code is
